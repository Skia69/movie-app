## Reflection
This was a 2 week long project built during my front-end web development bootcamp at Re-coded. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to fetch data from themoviedb API and filter them based on what they were interested in, such as 'category'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.0` and `tailwindcss`.
